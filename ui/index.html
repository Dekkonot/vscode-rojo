        <li>You can use the "Rojo: Convert rojo.json to default.project.json" option in the Command Panel (Ctrl+Shift+P) to attempt to migrate automatically.</li>
        <li>The "releaseType" option which previously allowed you to select pre-release or release has been removed in favor of a "releaseBranch" setting which allows you to specify the major release version you want to use. 0.5.x is now the default major release version.</li>
        <li>You can still bind projects to specific Rojo versions by setting the "targetVersion" option at the workspace level.</li>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Want to have more than one Rojo project open at once? VS Code allows you to add multiple root folders to your workspace, and this extension supports that out of the box! Right-click on a blank background portion of the Explorer panel, and click "Add folders to workspace". As long as a <code>default.project.json</code> file exists at the top level of that folder, you'll be able to use this extension with as many Rojo projects as you want to have open at once.</li>
        <li>You can and definitely should be using Git to keep your project under source control. This gives you <em>tons</em> of benefits, like...</li>
        <li>Add open-source modules (like <a href="https://github.com/Roblox/Roact" target="_blank">Roact</a>) to your game easily by adding them as a <a href="https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255" target="_blank">Git submodule</a>.</li>
