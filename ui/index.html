      <h2>News</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rojo v0.5.x is now supported!</strong> Check out <a href="https://lpghatguy.github.io/rojo/migrating-to-epiphany/">this page</a> for details on how to migrate your project.</li>
        <li>At the time of writing, v0.5.x is a pre-release. To enable automatic pre-release downloads, open the extension settings panel and select the "pre-release" release type. <strong>Note: VS Code may need to be reloaded after this change.</strong></li>
        <li>You can now target a specific Rojo version instead of the latest. Change the <code>targetVersion</code> setting to the tag name of the release you want to install (for example, <code>v0.4.13</code>). You can change this at the workspace level to lock projects to specific Rojo versions for compatibility.</li>
        <li>The "Rojo: Create Partition Here" context menu entry is now "Sync from here" and is compatible with both Rojo v0.4.x and v0.5.x.</li>
        <li>Use the "Rojo: convert rojo.json to default.project.json" command to attempt automatic conversion to 0.5.x</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Roblox Studio Plugin</h2>
      <p><strong>You need to install a plugin into Roblox Studio to use Rojo!</strong> You can either install the plugin from the <strong>Roblox plugin page</strong> (but then you will need to click "Update" in the Studio plugins panel every time Rojo updates), or you can let this extension <strong>manage and install the plugin for you</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Rojo Quick-Start Guide</h2>
      <p class="alert hidden" id="folder-alert"><strong>You must open a folder to follow this guide.</strong> This extension will only work if you have opened a folder through File &gt; Open Folder. For this guide, you should create a fresh folder and open it in VS Code, then come back here with <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> and enter <code>Rojo: Show welcome screen</code>. <span>&mdash; <strong>Yeah, we're talking to you, buster.</strong> This message only shows up if you don't have a folder open! ðŸ˜‰</span></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>To start using Rojo, you need a Rojo configuration file in the top level of your currently-opened workspace. You can generate one of these files by <strong>opening</strong> the command panel (<code >Ctrl+Shift+P</code>) and <strong>choosing</strong> <code>Rojo: Initialize</code>.</p>
          <p>You will see that a <code>rojo.json</code> file has been generated in your workspace. And it should have opened automatically, right over there! ðŸ‘‰</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In this file, you will define how Rojo should take files from your computer and put them into Roblox Studio. The default configuration doesn't do anything, so we should tell Rojo where your code is, and where we want to put it in Roblox.</p>
          <p>First, <strong>change</strong> the <code>name</code> property to something that represents your project. Leave <code>servePort</code> at its default value (only port 8000 is supported at the time of writing).</p>
          <p>Now, let's get our workspace ready with some sample code. Using the New Folder button in VS Code, <strong>create</strong> a new folder in the same directory that your <code>rojo.json</code> is in to contain your Lua files. (We will be naming our folder <code>Game</code> in this example.) Then, inside your new folder, <strong>create</strong> a simple Lua file (like <code>HelloWorld.lua</code>) and write whatever you want inside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Next, you will be creating your first <em>partition</em>. Partitions define how code should be transferred between the filesystem and Roblox by mapping directories and files to Roblox objects. A Rojo project can (and should) be made up of many, smaller partitions. You can create as many partitions as you want.</p>
          <p><strong>Right-click</strong> on the folder you created in the last step ("Game" in our case) in the VS Code Explorer panel, and <strong>choose</strong> "Rojo: Create partition here...". In the input box that shows up in the top-center of your screen, <strong>type</strong> <code>ServerScriptService.My Project</code> and press Enter.</p>
          <p>Each partition has:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A key name (the key in the <code>partitions</code> object), which is used for labelling and debugging and can be whatever you wish.</li>
            <li><code>path</code>, a relative path from <code>rojo.json</code> to a folder containing your Lua files.</li>
            <li><code>target</code>, a dot-separated location in Roblox, relative to <code>game</code>. (<code>StarterPlayer.StarterCharacterScripts.MyFolder</code> is a valid example)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="alert">Anything inside of a partition will be made to match what's on disk <em>exactly</em>, so that means Rojo <strong>will delete</strong> objects in Roblox that don't exist on disk. You should use lots of smaller partitions if necessary so you're only managing the scripts/objects you <em>really</em> care about.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Now, it's time for the magic. Look in the bottom-right corner of VS Code (on the bar), and you should see a button that says "Start Rojo". You'll need to <strong>click</strong> this button whenever you want to work on your game so Rojo knows to send your files to Roblox Studio. When it's on, you'll see the lightning bolt icon change to an eye icon, indicating it's watching for your changes. ðŸ‘€</p>
          <p class="alert">Make sure you've opened a fresh instance of Roblox Studio to ensure the plugin has installed correctly.</p>
          <p><strong>Open</strong> Roblox Studio, and <strong>create</strong> a new, blank place. <strong>Click</strong> on "Game Settings" on the Home tab, click "Security", and then <strong>change</strong> "Allow HTTP requests" to "on".</p>
          <p>Finally, <strong>click</strong> on the plugins tab, and find the Rojo buttons. <strong>Click</strong> the "Sync In" button. (For automatic syncing, you can use "Toggle Polling" instead.)</p>
          <p>You should now see your Lua file inside a folder called "My Project" in ServerScriptService! Now you're all set up to continue working on your awesome game.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>Now that you've got the hang of using Rojo, you should take a look at the <a href="https://lpghatguy.github.io/rojo/sync-details/" target="_blank">official documentation</a> which dives in deeper on some more advanced features of Rojo that you'll <strong>definitely</strong> want to know about! Learn how to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make your scripts become server Scripts and LocalScripts.</li>
        <li>Represent other instances (like RemoteEvents or *Value objects) as files on your computer, and have them be synced in next to your code.</li>
        <li>Have scripts inside of other scripts.</li>
        <li>And more!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the "Toggle Polling" button in Roblox Studio to enable automatic syncing whenever you make a file change in VS Code.</li>
        <li><strong>Want to have more than one Rojo project open at once?</strong> VS Code allows you to add multiple root folders to your workspace, and this extension supports that out of the box! Right-click on a blank background portion of the Explorer panel, and click "Add folders to workspace". As long as a <code>rojo.json</code> file exists at the top level of that folder, you'll be able to use this extension with as many Rojo projects as you want to have open at once.</li>
        <li>Search for "Lua" extensions to give you Lua linting, snippets, and automatic syntax error checking.</li>
        <li>You can and definitely should be using Git to keep your project under source control. This gives you <em>tons</em> of benefits, like...</li>
        <li>Add open-source modules (like <a href="https://github.com/Roblox/Roact" target="_blank">Roact</a>) to your game easily by adding them as a <a href="https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255" target="_blank">Git submodule</a>.</li>
